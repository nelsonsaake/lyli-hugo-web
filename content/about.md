## THE VIRUS

There is a virus that changes the first 150kb according to [this site](); and adds **.lyli** to the name of the files it corrupts. 

## THE APP

What comes after the last dot "." in the name of the file, tells the computer what kind of file it is; and what softwares can open or play the file. 

When the virus adds .lyli to the end of the file name, it makes the file un-recognisable to the computer. If it that part of the file name is removed, the computer can recognise the file.  

That is what the current version of this app does: rename affected files removing the .lyli add to the file-names. Imagine going through your computer and renaming the files one after the other, very tedious work. The app is designed to simply go through the computer, find files that affected, and rename them; removing .lyli from the name of the file.

Remember I mentioned the virus also changes what is in the file? After correcting the file-names: some files may still not open. Some file will be partially useful and for some, it would be as if no harm was done.

### Example

If a pdf was corrupted by the virus and the name was corrected. The first page might not show, but everything else will show.

## Note

The current version of the app corrects the name of affected files. It **DOES NOT** reverse the damage done to the content of the file. Something is better than nothing right?
