Between the time I made my last entry and latest 28th I was done with the code and it was working. I also sent it to Alex; it was his computer that was infected, and, ultimately what brought me here to you. After, I played around the UI a bit and lazy-ed around for most part till today.   <!--more-->

If I hadn't mention: I’ve been on break, actually the whole office was on break, from work since 23rd of Dec 2020; and we are said to resume on the 7th of Jan 2021. I later found out that work actually resumes on 4th, on the 4th. So, I missed work on the 4th.  

{{< story/problem >}} Today I got the git work. I was git kept failing to push to GitHub, and I was getting an error every time I tried; unfortunately, I cannot share the exact error. I didn’t write it down. The part I can remember is "curl hung up" or something similar. I thought maybe the files were too many or there were some files that cannot be written to GitHub. I only get the error when I am pushing to GitHub. {{< /story/problem >}}

{{< story/solution >}} I removed git from the entire project and added it to the directory containing the source code and the application resources. Viola, it worked. {{< /story/solution >}}

The new plan is to improve on the UI, create some other content on the app and push it all on a website and add ads to it. This way, I can generate some revenue. The new objective is:

<ol>
    <li>
        <ul>
            <li>clean up the code. - done 12/01/2021</li>
            <li>comment the code - done 12/01/2021</li>
            <li>talk about some Qt topics related to the code - done 12/01/2021</li>
            <li>develop the topics - started 15/01/2021,</li>
            <li>improve the UI - done 3/01/2021</li>
            <li>add a sequential diagram if necessary</li>
            <li>story of how the app was built, we will call this one “How to magically edit files.” – done error
                checking and editing 26/01/2021, -</li>
            <li>some issues that arose as I was writing the code and the solutions I came across or the fixes I found.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <ul>
            <li>Let Komla make me a site</li>
            <li>Get an AdSense account </li>
            <li>Connect the two</li>
            <li>Share the link on Quora, Stack Overflow (I think it’s time I make an account there), LinkedIn, twitter,
                Facebook (only in forums that counts not on my main timeline), IG sure if I can find a way that this
                makes since for IG and any other platform I can find.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
