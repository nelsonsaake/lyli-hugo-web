## 5:23pm

Between the time I made my last entry and latest 28th I was done with the code and it was working. I also sent it to Alex; it was his computer that was infected, and, ultimately what brought me here to you. After, I played around the UI a bit and lazy-ed around for most part till today.   <!--more-->

If I hadn't mention: I’ve been on break. Actually the whole office was on break, since 23rd of December 2020 to resume on the 7th of Jan 2021. I later found out that work actually resumes on 4th, on the 4th. So, I missed work on the 4th.

### Problem

Today I got the git to work. It kept failing to push to GitHub, and I was getting an error every time I tried; unfortunately, I cannot share the exact error. I didn’t write it down or save it. The part I can remember is "curl hung up" or something similar. I thought maybe the files were too many or there were some files that cannot be written to GitHub. I only get the error when I am pushing to GitHub.

### Solution

I removed git from the entire project and added it to the directory containing the source code and the application resources. Viola, it worked.

The new plan is to improve on the UI, create some other content relevant to the app and push it all on a website and add Ads to it. This way, I can generate some revenue. The new plan:

1. 
   + Clean up the code - done 12/01/2021
   + Comment the code - done 12/01/2021
   + Talk about some Qt topics related to the code - done 12/01/2021
   + Develop the topics - started 15/01/2021,
   + Improve the UI - done 3/01/2021
   + Add a sequential diagram if necessary
   + Story of how the app was built, we will call this one “How to magically edit files”. 
      - done error checking and editing 26/01/2021
   + some issues that arose as I was writing the code and the solutions I found for them.  
2.
   + Let Komla make me a site
   + Get an AdSense account 
   + Connect the two
   + Share the link on Quora, Stack Overflow (I think it’s time I make an account there), LinkedIn, twitter,
   + Facebook(only in forums that counts not on my main timeline), IG sure if I can find a way that this makes sense for IG and any other platform I can find.
