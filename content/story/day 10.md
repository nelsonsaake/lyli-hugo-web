I finished the Icon from yesterday and added it to the program.

So now I'm just doing touch ups and testing. Now I have to run the program to test where if it will actually rename some files.  Next, I will add a cancel feature to allow the user to cancel the process after it had started. And then I will also add a two modes: 
1. allow user to simply select scan to scan the entire computer, 
2. or choose the a folder to scan. This option will be the expert mode.   <!--more-->

{{< story/time "11" "17" "am" >}}

After a few tweaks, rename test went through. 

{{< story/time "12" "16" "pm" >}}

Cancel feature added successfully. 

{{< story/time "12" "51" "pm" >}}

Expert mode and simple options have been provided. So, the user doesn't have to deal with the process of selecting folder if they donâ€™t know exactly where to search. At the same time saving time for users who know exactly where to search. 

{{< story/time "1" "41" "pm" >}}

Scan feature implemented in the UI. 

{{< story/time "2" "39" "pm" >}}

{{< story/problem >}} Cancel is not working. {{< /story/problem >}}

{{< story/time "9" "19" "pm" >}}

The cancel is working and software is being packaged. 

I will finish up when I get the room, currently outside, under some trees on campus. I live in a school bungalow with uncle, his wife, and children. They are interesting cousins really. I love working and enjoying some cool breeze.  
I took a break earlier after the 2:39 pm log. And I took stroll with a lady. Pretty lady. Yes, developers can take strolls with ladies and have interesting conversation. 

Back to business, I the past I have used Inno setup to package my software in the past. Inno setup and a couple of others. But I will do some searches and see if there is a new kid on the block.
