So now I'm just doing touch ups and testing. It’s left to run test where it will actually rename some files.  
Next, I will add a cancel feature to allow the user to cancel the process after it started. And I will add a stacked widget to allow user to simply select scan, first side and on the second side, an input to supply a root directory. The second side will be the expert mode.   <!--more-->

After a few tweaks, rename test went through. 

{{< story/time "12" "16" "pm" >}}

Cancel feature added successfully. 

{{< story/time "12" "51" "pm" >}}

Expert mode and simple interface options have been provided. So, the user doesn't have to deal with the process of selecting folder if they don’t know exactly where to search. At the same time saving time for users who know exactly where to search. 

{{< story/time "1" "41" "pm" >}}

Scan feature implemented in the UI. 

{{< story/time "2" "39" "pm" >}}

{{< story/problem >}} Cancel is not working. {{< /story/problem >}}

{{< story/time "9" "19" "pm" >}}

The cancel is working and software is being packaged. 

I will finish up when I get the room, currently outside, under some trees on campus. I live in a school bungalow with uncle, his wife, and children. They are interesting cousins really. I love working and enjoying some cool breeze.  
I took a break earlier after the 2:39 pm log. And I took stroll with a lady. Pretty lady. Yes, developers can take strolls with ladies and have interesting conversation. 

Back to business, I the past I have used Inno setup to package my software in the past. Inno setup and a couple of others. But I will do some searches and see if there is a new kid on the block.
