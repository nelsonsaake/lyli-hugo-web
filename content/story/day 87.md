Komla didn't get back to me, I think he's busy with work. I have to do the website myself. I really didn't want to. I've been dragging my feet and doing it slowly. 

Now I've got something. The site is live since 19th Feb 2021 but I'm still working on the content and the UI. I decide to use hugo static site builder. I'm using the PaperMod theme; and adding my own twist to the theme.  <!--more-->

By 29th of Jan 2021, I had Hugo setup and already trying out themes. And by the 19th of Feb 2021, I had selected my theme and some content and made the site live. Now I'm working on the content and presentation of content.
