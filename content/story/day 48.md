As of two days ago, I had finished restructuring and commenting the code. Today I took some first run at "the Qt related topic". 

I walked around and did some audio recording. Next steps:
+ Go through the recording a make some points.
+ Transcribe the recording if necessary
+ Research missing facts.
+ Work on scenarios and constructs to explain what you want to explain.
+ Find relevant resource and add them.  <!--more-->

Output here is PowerPoint documents and a video where Iâ€™m presenting using the PowerPoint document.

If Komla doesn't get back me on the website, I will contact him again.
