I didn't really do any work today. I just refactored(reorganized and rearranged) some parts of the code to see if I can make more readable and keep it working. But it just not breaking my way. So, I've decided I will get a different version and Qt tomorrow and try this again. If this doesn't work. I'm going old school C++. <!--more--> 

No framework, nothing. Just me and the standard libraries. It would be incredible. The snake case naming conversion, Pointers, std::thread, cout <<, cerr <<, system(). I will even checkout the C++ returning tuple from a function approach Komla just told me about. Hehehe it would be incredible. 

But I really don't want to spend any more time on this project. I want to finish and be done with it ASAP.
