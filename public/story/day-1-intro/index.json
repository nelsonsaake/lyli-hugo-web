Sometimes we will put together about 5 laptops and network them together with a printer and one machine is setup to be the sever. We also handle walk-in problems related to software programs issued by the company. \u003c!--more--\u003e\r\n\r\nOne day at work, I got to work on a Laptop. It was old, had a few cracks and scratches but it was steady. It was one of those laptops that had a place for CDs. We call the thing that takes the CD, the `CD ROM Drives`. This laptop's CD ROM Drive was loose. It could easy fall out if you're not careful. The laptop was small about 14ichs.\r\n\r\nThe problem with the laptop is: all the files on it got corrupted. Some virus corrupted it. What the virus did was add `.lyli` to end of each file. On top of that, it changed somethings in the files. \r\n\r\nA music file usually ends with `.mp3`, not always, but mostly. The name of the song will appear and then `.mp3` will follow. Sometimes the computer won't show the `.mp3` but it usually there. The `.mp3` at the end of the name of the file, tells the computer it is a song. So when you try to open it, may be by double clicking it, the computer would know which program to use. This `.mp3` is what is refered to as a `file extension`. \r\n\r\nA video file may have `.mp4` or `.mkv` or ... as the extension. The extension is different for a picture, a pdf file, a word document, power point file ... . What happens when something is added to it? like in this case `.lyli`; the computer can't understand it any more. Because the computer won't have any program to open it or play it. When you try to open it, you may get an unknown file type message. Or the computer would ask you to choose a program to open the file. \r\n\r\nThe way to fix it, is simply: rename the file. Remove the `.lyli` at the end of the filename. Renaming all the files on your computer can be tedious, that is why this program was written. To go through your files, find files ending with `.lyli` and remove `.lyli` from the name.\r\n\r\nRecall I mentioned, the virus also changes things in the file? This program can't fix that. What happens after the renaming is, some files will be readable some will be damaged for good. Something is better than nothing right?\r\n\r\nThis story is my entry as try to build the program.\r\n\r\n\u003c!-- {{\u003c story/nav next=\"day-1\" \u003e}} --\u003e\r\n",
