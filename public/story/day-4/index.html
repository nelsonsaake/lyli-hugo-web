My 3-segment approach looked promising until I run the code. I got an error.



    
        Problem
    
    
         The error was cause by SQL query on one thread, trying to use database on a different thread. 
    

This is good news. This is proof that the threads are working like they are supposed to. I check online: on how to deal with this error. The solution was one connection per thread. That&rsquo;s the database and all communication with the database should be on one thread; or at least that&rsquo;s how I understand it.">
