I also sent it to Alex; it was his computer that was infected, and, ultimately what brought me here to you. After, I played around the UI a bit and lazy-ed around for most part till today.   \u003c!--more--\u003e\r\n\r\nIf I hadn't mention: I’ve been on break. Actually the whole office was on break, since 23rd of December 2020 to resume on the 7th of Jan 2021. I later found out that work actually resumes on 4th, on the 4th. So, I missed work on the 4th.  \r\n\r\n\u003c!-- {{\u003c story/problem \u003e}} --\u003e\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nToday I got the git to work. It kept failing to push to GitHub, and I was getting an error every time I tried; unfortunately, I cannot share the exact error. I didn’t write it down or save it. The part I can remember is \"curl hung up\" or something similar. I thought maybe the files were too many or there were some files that cannot be written to GitHub. I only get the error when I am pushing to GitHub. \r\n \r\n\u003c!-- {{\u003c /story/problem \u003e}} --\u003e\r\n---\r\n\r\n\u003c!-- {{\u003c story/solution \u003e}}  --\u003e\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nI removed git from the entire project and added it to the directory containing the source code and the application resources. Viola, it worked. \r\n\r\n\u003c!-- {{\u003c /story/solution \u003e}} --\u003e\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe new plan is to improve on the UI, create some other content relevant to the app and push it all on a website and add Ads to it. This way, I can generate some revenue. The new plan:\r\n\r\n1. \r\n   + Clean up the code - done 12/01/2021\r\n   + Comment the code - done 12/01/2021\r\n   + Talk about some Qt topics related to the code - done 12/01/2021\r\n   + Develop the topics - started 15/01/2021,\r\n   + Improve the UI - done 3/01/2021\r\n   + Add a sequential diagram if necessary\r\n   + Story of how the app was built, we will call this one “How to magically edit files”. \r\n      - done error checking and editing 26/01/2021\r\n   + some issues that arose as I was writing the code and the solutions I found for them.  \r\n2.\r\n   + Let Komla make me a site\r\n   + Get an AdSense account \r\n   + Connect the two\r\n   + Share the link on Quora, Stack Overflow (I think it’s time I make an account there), LinkedIn, twitter,\r\n   + Facebook(only in forums that counts not on my main timeline), IG sure if I can find a way that this makes sense for IG and any other platform I can find.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003c!-- {{\u003c story/nav prev=\"day-27\" next=\"day-48\" \u003e}} --\u003e\r\n",
