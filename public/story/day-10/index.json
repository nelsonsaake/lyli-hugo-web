Now I have to run the program to test if it will actually rename some files. Next, I will add a cancel feature to allow the user to cancel the process after it had started. And then I will also add a two modes: \r\n+ Allow user to simply select scan to scan the entire computer, \r\n+ Or choose the a folder to scan. This option will be the expert mode.   \u003c!--more--\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003c!-- {{\u003c story/time \"11\" \"17\" \"am\" \u003e}} --\u003e\r\n## 11:17am\r\n\r\nAfter a few tweaks, rename test went through. \r\n\r\n\u003c!-- {{\u003c story/time \"12\" \"16\" \"pm\" \u003e}} --\u003e\r\n## 12:16pm\r\n\r\nCancel feature added successfully. \r\n\r\n\u003c!-- {{\u003c story/time \"12\" \"51\" \"pm\" \u003e}} --\u003e\r\n## 12:51pm\r\n\r\nExpert mode and simple options have been provided. So, the user doesn't have to deal with the process of selecting folder if they donâ€™t know exactly where to search. At the same time saving time for users who know exactly where to search. \r\n\r\n\u003c!-- {{\u003c story/time \"1\" \"41\" \"pm\" \u003e}}\r\n## 1:41pm\r\n\r\nScan feature implemented in the UI.   --\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003c!-- {{\u003c story/time \"2\" \"39\" \"pm\" \u003e}} --\u003e\r\n## 2:39pm\r\n\r\n\u003c!-- {{\u003c story/problem \u003e}}  --\u003e\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nCancel is not working. \r\n\r\n\u003c!-- {{\u003c /story/problem \u003e}} --\u003e\r\n---\r\n\r\n\u003c!-- {{\u003c story/time \"9\" \"19\" \"pm\" \u003e}} --\u003e\r\n## 9:19pm\r\n\r\nThe cancel is now working and software is being packaged. \r\n\r\nSo I will take a pause here and finish when I get to the house. Currently I'm outside the house. I've found a place under some trees on campus. I live in a school bungalow with uncle, his wife, and children. They are interesting cousins really. They bungalow is on campus. I love working and enjoying some cool breeze. So something I leave the house, find some place to sit on campus and work.\r\n\r\nI took a break earlier after the 2:39pm log. And I took stroll with a lady. Pretty lady. Yes, developers can take strolls with ladies and have interesting conversation. \r\n\r\nBack to business, I the past I have used `Inno setup` when I want to package a software. `Inno setup` and a couple of others. But, I will do some searches and see if there is a new kid on the block. \r\n\r\nThe output of programming is usually a group of files and folders that needs to be managed together. During installing on a computer all those files must be installed together and when the user wants to un-install a program all those files and folders must be remove among other things. `Inno setup` and programs like it, take of things like this so developers don't have to unless they want to.\r\n\r\n\u003c!-- {{\u003c story/nav prev=\"day-9\" next=\"day-17\" \u003e}} --\u003e\r\n",
