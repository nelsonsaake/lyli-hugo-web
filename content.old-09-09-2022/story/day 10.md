I finished the Icon from yesterday and added it to the program.

So now I'm just doing touch ups and testing. Now I have to run the program to test if it will actually rename some files. Next, I will add a cancel feature to allow the user to cancel the process after it had started. And then I will also add a two modes: 
+ Allow user to simply select scan to scan the entire computer, 
+ Or choose the a folder to scan. This option will be the expert mode.   <!--more-->

{{< story/time "11" "17" "am" >}}

After a few tweaks, rename test went through. 

{{< story/time "12" "16" "pm" >}}

Cancel feature added successfully. 

{{< story/time "12" "51" "pm" >}}

Expert mode and simple options have been provided. So, the user doesn't have to deal with the process of selecting folder if they donâ€™t know exactly where to search. At the same time saving time for users who know exactly where to search. 

<!-- {{< story/time "1" "41" "pm" >}}

Scan feature implemented in the UI.   -->

{{< story/time "2" "39" "pm" >}}

{{< story/problem >}} Cancel is not working. {{< /story/problem >}}

{{< story/time "9" "19" "pm" >}}

The cancel is now working and software is being packaged. 

So I will take a pause here and finish when I get to the house. Currently I'm outside the house. I've found a place under some trees on campus. I live in a school bungalow with uncle, his wife, and children. They are interesting cousins really. They bungalow is on campus. I love working and enjoying some cool breeze. So something I leave the house, find some place to sit on campus and work.

I took a break earlier after the 2:39pm log. And I took stroll with a lady. Pretty lady. Yes, developers can take strolls with ladies and have interesting conversation. 

Back to business, I the past I have used `Inno setup` when I want to package a software. `Inno setup` and a couple of others. But, I will do some searches and see if there is a new kid on the block. 

The output of programming is usually a group of files and folders that needs to be managed together. During installing on a computer all those files must be installed together and when the user wants to un-install a program all those files and folders must be remove among other things. `Inno setup` and programs like it, take of things like this so developers don't have to unless they want to.
